    <h2>Subjects of study
    </h2>
    <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall <br> 
        somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just <br>
        kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued<br>
        are as follows, in order of priority:
    </p>
    <ol id="lista-ordenada">
        <li>
            Turning H20 into wine, and the health benefits of Rcsveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)
        </li>
        <li>
            Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplaycrs at tcmpraturcs exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the
        </li>
        <li>
            <u>HTML</u> and <u>CSS</u> constructs for representing musical scores.
        </li>
        
    </ol>
    <p>
        So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the <br>
        research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
    </p>

        Exotic dance moves
    </h2>
    <p>
        Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work. I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, <br>
        my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
    </p>
    <p>
        Polynesian chicken dance
    </p>
    <ol>
        A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC. a whole village would dance around <br>
        in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful*.
    </ol>
    <p>Icelandic brownian shuffle

    </p>
    <ol>
        Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which <br>
        huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in impcrccptablytiny,<br>
        very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired <br>
        modem styles such as Twerking.
    </ol>
    <p>Arctic robot dance
    </p>
    <ol>
        An interesting example of historic misinformation. English explorers in the 1960s believed to have <br>
        discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic*, stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants <br>
        of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this <br>
        because they were really cold.
    </ol>

    <p>
        For more of my research, <a href="carta.index">see my exotic dance research page.</a>
    </p>
    <p>Yours sincerely.</p>
